# DLS_streamlit_kit_tutor
Tutorial on working with Streamlit as part of the Computer Vision course from the Deep Learning School (MIPT)

## Preparation of the working environment

Streamlit is a popular open source Python library widely used by ML developers to show the product. Its main advantage is that working with it ** DOES NOT require** special knowledge of js/css/html/go and so on to create websites. A good command of Python and the framework itself is enough.

### Creating a virtual environment:
```shell
python -m venv venv
```

### Activate it:

* Linux:

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```
* Windows:

```shell
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Upgrade pip:
```shell
 pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Install Streamlit:
```shell
 pip install streamlit
```

### Let's launch the demo library:
```shell
streamlit hello
```

If everything worked out correctly, a demo page will open where you can get acquainted with the features provided by Streamlit.

## Hello, world!
Adding a file to the project `hello.py ` of the following content:

* Importing the streamlit library
```python
import streamlite as st
```

* Output text
```python
st.text("Hello world!")
```
* Run the following command in the terminal:
```shell
streamlit run hello.py
```
We got a simple application that can be accessed locally at `localhost:8501`

* Modify `hello.py `

```python
import streamlit as st

if st.button('Click me!'):
    st.write('Hello, DLS Student! ü§ñ')
```
* You can still see what happens in the same place `localhost:8501`

## Publishing to the cloud
This is what the pipeline for publishing a project to the Streamlit cloud looks like. Important clarification: it will be a low-load application on the CPU. If you want a GPU, then you need to rent a virtual machine and run your application from it.

## Registration stages
Visit the cloud's website https://streamlit.io/cloud

![](https://github.com/Kotyga/DLS_streamlit_kit_tutor/blob/main/src/reg_1.png)

Click `Get started`

Creating an account

Authorization via GitHub is required

Next, your workspace opens with projects. For a new project, click `Create App` in the upper right corner

Then fill in the appropriate fields. If the main file was not found, Streamlit will tell you about it.

It is important to clarify that in order for your application to be installed correctly, your repository must have:
1. Start page
2. The file requirements.txt

If, for example, you want to create a [multipage](https://docs.streamlet.io/develop/concepts/multipage-apps/pages-directory), then the structure is as follows (names are arbitrary):
```
your_working_directory/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ a_page.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ another_page.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your_homepage.py
```
